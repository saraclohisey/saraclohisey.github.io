The increasing body of literature describing the role of host factors in COVID- 19 pathogenesis demonstrates the need to combine diverse, multi-omic data to evaluate and substantiate the most robust evidence and inform development of therapies. Here we present a dynamic ranking of host genes implicated in human betacoronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, seasonal coronaviruses). Researchers can search and review the ranked genes and the contribution of different experimental methods to gene rank [here](https://baillielab.net/maic/covid19)
