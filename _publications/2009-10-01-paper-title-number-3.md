We were able to quantify overrepresentation of host RNA features among the sequences that were 'Cap-snatched' by IAV. We demonstrate biased snatching of numerous host RNAs, particularly small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and avoidance of host transcripts encoding host ribosomal proteins, which are required by IAV for replication. We then used a systems approach to describe the transcriptional landscape of the host response to IAV, observing many new features.
