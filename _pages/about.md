My main research interest is how cells of the immune system react to viral infections and how, in turn, the virus interacts with immune cells.  Exploring the host-pathogen interaction is integral to understanding why some people become very sick when they are infected with viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. 

As a Co-Investigator on the [GenOMICC study](https://www.genomicc.org) I'm interested in how changes to DNA in the host can influence the interaction between them and the pathogen. 

I use transcriptomics (a process to read instructions a cell makes) to find out how a cell responds to a virus. I'm interested in how these instructions change during infection, and how that relates to the severity of the illness experienced by the host (the person infected).
