I'm Sara Clohisey, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Core Scientist in the Baillie Lab at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh.

My main research interest is how cells of the immune system react to viral infections and how, in turn, the virus interacts with immune cells.  Exploring the host-pathogen interaction is integral to understanding why some people become very sick when they are infected with viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. 

I use transcriptomics (a process to read instructions a cell makes) to find out how a cell responds to a virus. I'm interested in how these instructions change during infection, and how that relates to the severity of the illness experienced by the host (the person infected).

Recently, we completed sampling on a study looking at influenza susceptibility in the Scottish population and is using sensitive techniques, such as Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) and Whole Genome Sequencing, to investigate the interface between virus and host on a molecular scale.
