I'm a Research Fellow and Core Scientist in the Baillie lab. You can read more about our work [here](https://baillielab.net/)!  

I run a range of activities and am forging an independent research programme using genomics and genome editing to understand the mechanisms underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a devastating lung problem in preterm infants.

As a Co-Investigator on the [GenOMICC study](https://www.genomicc.org) and Lead Researcher for the neonatal arm, I'm interested in how changes to DNA in can influence how sick a baby might become following preterm birth and ventilation.
