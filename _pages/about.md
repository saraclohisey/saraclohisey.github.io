Sara joined the Baillie lab in 2014 as a postdoctoral research fellow. Previously, she graduated with first class honours from Trinity College Dublin after which she completed a PhD studying determinants of cytoskeletal function in Drosophila at the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology](https://ohkura.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html).  


Her main interest is how cells of the immune system react to viral infections and how, in turn, the virus interacts with immune cells.  


This host-pathogen interaction is integral to understanding why some people become very sick when they are infected with viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.  


Sara has recently completed sampling on a study looking at influenza susceptibility in the Scottish population and is using sensitive techniques, such as Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) and Whole Genome Sequencing, to investigate this on a molecular scale.
