Hello! 

I'm Sara, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Baillie Lab at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh.

My main research interest is how cells of the immune system react to viral infections and how, in turn, the virus interacts with immune cells.  

Exploring the host-pathogen interaction is integral to understanding why some people become very sick when they are infected with viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. 


I have recently completed sampling on a study looking at influenza susceptibility in the Scottish population and is using sensitive techniques, such as Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) and Whole Genome Sequencing, to investigate the interface between virus and host on a molecular scale.  

You can read about work of the [Baillie Lab](https://baillielab.net/)!  

I joined the Baillie lab in 2014 as a postdoctoral research fellow. Previously, I graduated from Trinity College Dublin after which I completed a PhD studying determinants of cytoskeletal function in Drosophila at the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology](https://ohkura.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html).
