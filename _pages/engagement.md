Lab Handbook
======
* In 2020 I wrote a lab handbook to help outline roles and responsibilities, and how to get help, when everyone was working from home. 

You can find it [here](https://github.com/saraclohisey/lab_handbook/Lab_Handbook.md)

FEBS writing award

* I was lucky, along with Dr. Zheng-Shan Chong, to contribute to this FEBS Journal ["Words of Advice"](https://network.febs.org/posts/words-of-advice-how-to-build-a-well-rounded-cv-and-get-hired-after-your-phd) feature!

Genetics Society Magazine
======
* I wrote a short [perspective](https://genetics.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Issue-83.pdf) while rolling out GenOMICC across the UK during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. What a time!

======
* I'm an active Peer-supporter at Easter Bush
